Large-scale projects benefit most from the type safety. Our developers favor its minimal configuration management, well-integrated IDE support and its ability to refactor code safely and gradually adopt types. With its <a href=""https://definitelytyped.org/"">good repository</a> of TypeScript-type definitions at hand, we benefit from all the rich JavaScript libraries while gaining type safety.</p>"

Contentful,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>Headless content management systems (CMSes) are becoming a common component of digital platforms. <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/""><strong>Contentful</strong></a> is a modern headless CMS that our teams have successfully integrated into their development workflows. We particularly like its API-first approach and implementation of <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/cms-as-code/"">CMS as code</a>. It supports powerful content modeling primitives as code and content model evolution scripts, which allow it to be treated like other data store schemas and enable <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"">evolutionary database design</a> practices to be applied to CMS development. Its robustness and a stream of new features, including a sandbox environment, have impressed our teams further and made Contentful our default choice in this space.</p>"

Micro frontends,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p>We've seen significant benefits from introducing <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a>, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a frontend monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the backend services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices. Since we first described <strong>micro frontends</strong> as a technique to address this issue, we've had almost universally positive experiences with the approach and have found a number of patterns to use micro frontends even as more and more code shifts from the server to the web browser. So far, <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">web components</a> have been elusive in this field, though.</p>"
Functional Programming,trial,techniques,TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0"">Functional programming (often abbreviated FP)</a></strong> is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.</p>"

Knative,assess,platforms,TRUE,"<p>Knative is Kubernetes-based platform to deploy and manage modern serverless workloads and originally developed by Google with the collaboration of many companies.

At a high level it looks at application architecting process as three distinct pieces — Building, Serving and Events. Knative is built on top of kubernetes and these pieces are deployed on kubernetes as custom resource definitions (CRDs).</p>"
