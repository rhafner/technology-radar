Contentful,adopt,platforms,TRUE,"<p>Headless content management systems (CMSes) are becoming a common component of digital platforms. <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/""><strong>Contentful</strong></a> is a modern headless CMS that our teams have successfully integrated into their development workflows. We particularly like its API-first approach and implementation of <a href=""http://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/cms-as-code/"">CMS as code</a>. It supports powerful content modeling primitives as code and content model evolution scripts, which allow it to be treated like other data store schemas and enable <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html"">evolutionary database design</a> practices to be applied to CMS development. Its robustness and a stream of new features, including a sandbox environment, have impressed our teams further and made Contentful our default choice in this space.</p>"

Clean code can be read and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. With understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintainability.</p>"
Micro frontends,assess,techniques,TRUE,"<p>We've seen significant benefits from introducing <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"">microservices</a>, which have allowed teams to scale the delivery of independently deployed and maintained services. Unfortunately, we've also seen many teams create a frontend monolith — a large, entangled browser application that sits on top of the backend services — largely neutralizing the benefits of microservices. Since we first described <strong>micro frontends</strong> as a technique to address this issue, we've had almost universally positive experiences with the approach and have found a number of patterns to use micro frontends even as more and more code shifts from the server to the web browser. So far, <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">web components</a> have been elusive in this field, though.</p>"
